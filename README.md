💖 Notes from the Developer (My First Build! 👶)
This project holds sentimental value for me as it represents a major milestone: it is my very first project built solely using HTML and CSS.

While the current design may be rudimentary (or, as I'd describe it, a very basic design 😅), it stands as a testament to my initial steps into web development. This project marks the beginning of my coding journey 🚀 and serves as a powerful reminder of the fundamental skills I've acquired. I have a strong emotional attachment to this work and plan to revisit it in the future for potential redesigns and feature updates! 💡
